    </p>


    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold Mounir Bellahbib and its
      parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners
      and licensors (if any) harmless from any claim or demand, including
      reasonable attorneys’ fees, due to or arising out of your: (a) use of
      the Application; (b) violation of this Agreement or any law or
      regulation; or (c) violation of any right of a third party.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Application is provided to you “AS IS” and “AS
      AVAILABLE” and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind.
      To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, Mounir Bellahbib, on
      its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their
      respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all
      warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with
      respect to the Application, including all implied warranties of
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
      non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of
      dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without
      limitation to the foregoing, Mounir Bellahbib provides no warranty or
      undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the

      reliability standards or be error-free or that any errors or defects can
      or will be corrected.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any information regarding sports results, live scores,
      gambling ratio, sports updates, statistics, or any other information
      published through the Application, is provided by different third
      parties, and not on the behalf of Application or any of its affiliates
      or representatives. Please note that such information does not
      constitute advice, a recommendation nor an authorized opinion, and does
      not replace the necessity of consulting with a professional to the
      extent necessary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Application shall not
      be liable for any mistakes, errors, or inaccuracy in the information
      published through the Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or
      limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable
      statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions
      and limitations may not apply to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the
      entire liability of Mounir Bellahbib and any of its suppliers under any
      provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the
      foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the
      Application.
    </p>

    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no
      event shall Mounir Bellahbib or its suppliers be liable for any special,
      incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including,
      but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or
      other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for
      loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or
      inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or
      third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise in
      connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if Mounir Bellahbib or
      any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and
      even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
    </p>


    <p>
      Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or
      limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
      limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
    </p>

    <p>
      If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
      unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted
      to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
      possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue
      in full force and effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right
      or to require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall
      not affect a party’s ability to exercise such right or require such
      performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach
      constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.
    </p>
